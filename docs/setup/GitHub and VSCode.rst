.. _GitHub new repo:

==============================
GitHub and VSCode
==============================

The info below is for the simplest approach where there is only the main branch locally which is being maintained and pushed to the github repository.

For github advice see: https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/importing-your-projects-to-github/importing-source-code-to-github/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github

----

GitHub account
------------------------------

* Create a fee account at github if you don't already have one.

----

VSCode starting from **creating a new empty repository**
------------------------------------------------------------

* Sign in at github
* Create new repo at github: https://github.com/ or at https://github.com/mygithubname?tab=repositories. 
* Name the new repo the same name as the project folder stored locally on your computer. 
* See :ref:`VSCode Project Folder and Sphinx`
* e.g. https://github.com/mygithubname/myrepo
* Do not create a readme file at this time.
* Do not select a license at this time.
* Adding a read me or selecting a license will cause an initial commit and will not show the code to use to create the git on your local machine.
* Copy the "create a new repository on the command line" code for use later.

.. code-block::

    echo "# myrepo" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/mygithubname/myrepo.git
    git push -u origin main

----

GitHub settings
------------------------------

* Set Repository default branch to ``main`` (``main`` is preferred branch name post 2020).
* https://github.com/settings/repositories

----

Initialize GitHub in VSCode
------------------------------

In VSCode, initialize git locally by following the steps:

Manually, step by step:

* Click on the ``source control icon`` on the left sidebar.
* Click ``initialise git repository``.
* Type in ``"initial commit"`` as the message.
* Click the ``tick icon`` to commit changes.


Alternatively, hook up remote branch in the VSCode terminal. 
Run from within the main VScode folder that the docs folder is within.

.. code-block::

    echo "<# myrepo>" >> README.md
    git init
    git add README.md
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git branch -M main
    git remote add origin https://github.com/mygithubname/myrepo.git
    git push -u origin main

.. note::

    README.rst can be used instead of README.md since GitHub also interprets .rst files.

----

Initialize GitHub in VSCode starting from **an existing repository**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In VSCode, run from within the main VScode folder that the docs folder is within.

.. code-block::

    git remote add origin https://github.com/mygithubname/myrepo.git
    git branch -M main
    git push -u origin main

----

VSCode GitHub updates
------------------------------

* Click on the ``source control icon`` on the left sidebar
* Type in ``"doc update"`` or specific details as the message in the Source Control section.
* Click the ``tick icon`` to commit changes
* The Source Control Repositories section has icons and dropdowns for key commands.
* To push the changes to GitHub, click the icon between the branch icon and tick icon that shows the Push message when hovering over it.

----

VSCode GitHub controls
------------------------------

* Press :kbd:`ctrl` + :kbd:`shift` + :kbd:`P` to open the Command Palette. 
* Start typing "Git" to see the various commands.

VSCode starting from **Cloning a repository**
------------------------------------------------------------

* For steps involved in starting by cloning a repository see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sz2EM-gkEs0&list=PLpPVLI0A0OkLBWbcctmGxxF6VHWSQw1hi&index=2
* If the repository is not a restructuredtext project with .rst files, ``sphinx-quickstart`` may need to be run once the repo is cloned to the local machine.
