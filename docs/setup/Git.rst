Install Git
------------------------------

Download and install git version 2.47.1 (as of 2025, or newer) from https://git-scm.com/. Use all defaults.

Check installed version of Git
---------------------------------

From the terminal in VSCode or from the command prompt, check the version of Git that is installed.

From the cmd prompt:

.. code-block::

    git --version

This is important because every Git commit uses this information,
and it's used in the commits you create.

From the cmd prompt:

.. code-block::

    git config --global user.name "my-github-name"

From the cmd prompt, check or confirm your settings with:

.. code-block::

    git config --list
