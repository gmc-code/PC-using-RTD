These docs provide a simple instruction list for setting up automatic updating of your project documentation hosted at ReadTheDocs.

**Overall Process**

Python -> Sphinx -> VSCode -> reStructuredText -> GitHub -> ReadTheDocs

#. Using Python, set up Sphinx to translate the .rst files into HTML (and PDF) file formats. 
#. In VSCode, create plain text source files in reStructuredText (.rst) format.
#. In VSCode, push the documentation changes to a GitHub repository. 
#. Set up ReadTheDocs to automatically update via a webhook to GitHub.

It starts by cloning a new GitHub repository to the computer. It is Mac based. It uses a text editor instead of VSCode.

The above steps are suitable for one author using the main branch only.
